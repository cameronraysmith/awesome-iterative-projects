# Awesome Iterative Projects

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A list of projects relying on [Iterative](https://github.com/iterative) tools to achieve awesomeness.

Missing something awesome? Anyone is welcome to [submit projects to this list](https://github.com/iterative/awesome-iterative-projects/blob/main/contributing.md).

## Tools & Libraries
* [`dvthis`](https://github.com/jcpsantiago/dvthis) - Utility functions and project templates for DVC pipelines using R.
* [COVID Genomics/Airflow-DVC](https://github.com/covid-genomics/airflow-dvc) - Airflow extension for DVC.
* [COVID Genomics/dvc-fs](https://github.com/covid-genomics/dvc-fs) - High-level abstraction for DVC file manipulation (listing & I/O) with basic support for [PyFilesystem2](https://github.com/PyFilesystem/pyfilesystem2).

## Tutorials
* [DVC Streamlit Example](https://github.com/sicara/dvc-streamlit-example) - Build a custom web UI with DVC and Streamlit for visually tracking & comparing model performance during R&D (adapted from [TensorFlow's transfer learning tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning)).

## Real-world Projects
