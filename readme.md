# Awesome Iterative Projects

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

This is list of Awesome projects using Iterative.AI tools from the Community. It will serve as a resource for all of our Community to help people conceptualize the different use cases for our tools.  We invite Community members to submit their projects to this list under the appropriate category below.  We look forward to sharing with the World all the amazing things our community builds with our tools and how they do it!

## Tools & Libraries
* [`dvthis`](https://github.com/jcpsantiago/dvthis) - Utility functions and project templates for DVC pipelines using R.
* [COVID Genomics/Airflow-DVC](https://github.com/covid-genomics/airflow-dvc) - Airflow extension for DVC.
* [COVID Genomics/dvc-fs](https://github.com/covid-genomics/dvc-fs) - High-level abstraction for DVC file manipulation (listing & I/O) with basic support for [PyFilesystem2](https://github.com/PyFilesystem/pyfilesystem2).

## Tutorials
* [DVC Streamlit Example](https://github.com/sicara/dvc-streamlit-example) - Build a custom web UI with DVC and Streamlit for visually tracking & comparing model performance during R&D (adapted from [TensorFlow's transfer learning tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning)).

## Real-world Projects
* [LensKit/lk-demo-experiment](https://github.com/lenskit/lk-demo-experiment) - Demo DVC experiment [pipeline (DAG)](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/glossary#pipeline-DAG) using multiple public datasets, preprocessing & training, and Jupyter notebooks.
* [ModelOriented/MAIR](https://github.com/ModelOriented/MAIR)- Monitoring impact of AI regulations.
